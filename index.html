        <h2>What are Facts ?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="factsinfo">
        <p>A fact is a true datum about one or more aspects of a circumstance. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means.
            For example, "This sentence contains words." accurately describes a linguistic fact, and "The sun is a star" accurately describes an astronomical fact. Further, "Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States" and "Abraham Lincoln was assassinated" both accurately describe historical facts. Generally speaking, facts are independent of belief and of knowledge and opinion.
            Facts are different from inferences, theories, values, and objects.

        <h2>Ethymology and Usage</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="ethymologyinfo">
        <p>The word fact derives from the Latin factum. It was first used in English with the same meaning: "a thing done or performed" - a meaning now obsolete. The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the mid-16th century.
            Barbara J. Shapiro wrote in her book A Culture of Fact how the concept of a fact evolved, starting within the English legal tradition of the 16th century.
            In 1870, Charles Sanders Peirce described in his book "The Fixation of Belief" four methods which people use to decide what they should believe: tenacity, method of authority, a priori and scientific method.
            The term fact also indicates a matter under discussion deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue.
            Alternatively, fact may also indicate an allegation or stipulation of something that may or may not be a true fact.
            Fact may also indicate findings derived through a process of evaluation, including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation.
            Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority. Roger Bacon wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."</p>

        <h2>In Philosophy</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="philosophyinfo">
        <p>In philosophy, the concept fact is considered in the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge, called epistemology and ontology, which studies concepts such as existence, being, becoming, and reality. Questions of objectivity and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A fact can be defined as something that is the case, in other words, a state of affairs.
            Facts may be understood as information, which makes a true sentence true: "A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true."[15] Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system" is about the fact that Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.</p>
